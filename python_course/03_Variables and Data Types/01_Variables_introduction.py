Variables in Python
What is a Variable?

A variable is a container used to store data in memory.
It allows us to store values and use them later in a program.

Example:

name = "vishwas"
age = 21


Here:

name is a variable storing a string

age is a variable storing an integer

How Variables Work in Python

Python automatically decides the data type of a variable based on the value assigned.

Example:

x = 10        # integer
y = 3.14      # float
z = "Hello"   # string


This is called dynamic typing.
