Indentation in Python:-
What is Indentation?

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a line of code.
In Python, indentation is very important because it defines the block of code.

Unlike other programming languages that use { }, Python uses indentation to group statements.

Why Indentation is Important

Defines blocks of code

Improves readability

Required in loops, functions, and conditions

Python will give an error if indentation is incorrect

Example Without Indentation (Error)
if True:
print("Hello")


This will give an IndentationError because the print statement is not indented.

Correct Example
if True:
    print("Hello")
