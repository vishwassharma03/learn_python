Comments in Python
What are Comments?

Comments are lines in a program that are ignored by the Python interpreter.
They are used to explain code, improve readability, and help other programmers understand the program.

Types of Comments in Python
1. Single-Line Comment

A single-line comment starts with the # symbol.

Example:
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello World")

2. Multi-Line Comment

Python does not have a special syntax for multi-line comments, but we can use:

Method 1: Multiple #
# This is a comment
# written in multiple lines
# to explain the code

Method 2: Triple Quotes (Docstring style)
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can be written using triple quotes.
"""
print("Hello")
